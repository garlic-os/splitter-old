This is the last state of the repository before I introduced SvelteKit. I thought I was going to make a Svelte-based interface in a new repo then move it back over to here, but what ended up happening instead is SvelteKit ate the whole backend and became the project. Meanwhile this repo just collected dust. Keeping it here for documentation's sake.
